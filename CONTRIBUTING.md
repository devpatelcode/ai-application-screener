# Contributing Guidelines

Thanks for your interest in improving this project. Contributions are welcome, including documentation updates, bug reports, feature requests, and code changes.

## Reporting Bugs

1. Open a new issue with a clear description
2. Please include:
   - Clear description of the issue and expected behavior
   - Environment info: OS, Python version, hiring-agent commit or version
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Relevant logs or stack traces

> [!TIP]
> If the bug involves PDF parsing or model output, attach a minimal PDF and the exact model you used.

## Feature Requests

1. Open a new issue describing the feature
2. Describe the problem, the proposed solution, and any alternatives you considered.

## Contributing Code

1. Open an issue first to discuss the change
2. Comment that you are working on it to avoid duplicate efforts
3. Fork the repo, then create a feature branch for your change

### Development

1. Fork and clone your fork
2. Create a fresh branch per change
3. Set up the environment and run the pipeline locally to validate changes
4. Run the CLI on a small sample to verify behavior

### Coding Style

* Use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for formatting
* Keep functions short and focused. Prefer pure helpers for prompt assembly and transformations

### Prompts and Providers

* Keep prompts declarative and provider agnostic
* Avoid model specific tokens or formatting that only one provider supports
* Changes to prompts should include short before and after examples in the pull request description

### Tests and Smoke Checks

* Validate changes with a couple of real resumes:
  * One run with Ollama using the default local model
* Add or adjust small smoke tests that exercise each stage with minimal inputs:
  * PDF to Markdown
  * Section extraction to JSON Resume
  * Evaluation to JSON with the required fields

### Commit Messages

* Use clear, imperative subjects, for example: `fix: handle en dash date ranges in work parser`
* Reference the issue number when applicable

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful and collaborative. If you see unacceptable behavior, report it through an issue or contact the maintainers.
